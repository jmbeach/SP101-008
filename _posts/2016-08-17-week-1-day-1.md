# Syllabus Review

## Textbook

+ Protagonistas: A Communicative Approach (1st Edition) - assignments on the web
+ Passcode - Supersite Plus Code w/WebSAM

## Learning Outcomes

+ A lot of outside classwork
+ The general goal of the class
  + Communicate orally at a basic level of Spanish in real-life situations
  + Basic proficiency in reading and writing
  + Ability to comprehend and discuss reading, audio recordings and videos at a basic level
  + Understanding of varied cultural aspects of the Spanish-speaking world

## Placement / Enrollment

+ If you feel like you might place higher in Spanish somehow, talk to the professor.

## Attendance

+ Every day you get a 'point' for attending. If you do not attend you get a 'zero' for that day
+ You get three days you can miss, but these are not distinguished between being sick and needing a mental health day.
  + Grade will start to drop after three days
  + If you miss nine classes or more, it's an automatic failing grade

## Participation

+ Just paying attention and doing group work etc.

## Grading

| assignment | worth
| --- | ---
| Attendance | 5 %
| Participation | 15 %
| Online homework | 20 %
| Projects(6) | 30 %
| Quizes(6) | 30 %

+ (Final exam is just your last quiz)

## Online homework

+ Students are *REQUIRED* to log in the first week of class!!!
+ Late assignments are not accepted.
+ Need to get signed up ASAP
  + Assignments start tomorrow night (syllabus quiz)
+ If you have technical issues with the program itself and you send them a support ticket and they agree that their site goofed up, then you can get your assignment graded late.

## Projects

+ You do some work at home and then present some of it in class
  + One of the projects is you create an imaginary person and then present that person in class.
  + Going out to a restaurant, etc

## Quizzes

+ Asses the knowledge we learn in class

## Language Policy

+ Use of English is supposed to be a last resort
+ The instructor is going to speak entirely in Spanish starting Friday and so are we apparently
  + We're expected to talk in stupid, broken Spanish

## Missed Assignment Policy

+ No excuses for missed assignments or not turned in projects
  + Same thing for quizzes
+ Lowest project and quiz grade will be dropped
  + So if you do miss a quiz or something, it will be dropped

## Plagiarism / Cheating

+ If you use a translation service or cheat, it will be noticed and action will be taken
+ However, use of google translate to look things up is encouraged
+ If someone helps you too much, that counts as cheating too
